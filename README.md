Install script and simple control panel for Minecraft

## When would I use this?
If you have a brand new Ubuntu (or equivalent) Linux server and you plan to use it for **only** 1 Minecraft server and you don't care if this script changes whatever it wants to change. Running this to reinstall Minecraft might not work and would be unwise!

The actual server administration uses mcrcon (https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon), which will be downloaded as part of the install process.

It will ask you a number of questions for the control panel and for server.properties, then it should just run until finished.

For post-install configuration, most of the relevant files will be in /var/opt/minecraft/
