# Pink Wool
BASH installation script and simple control panel for Minecraft

This can:
- Install Minecraft as a service on a 64-bit Linux server
- Configure some of server.properties
- Create daily .zip backups
- Create a web-based control panel

The control panel is a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) HTTPS server hosting a few PHP files with basic auth. If you don't have a fully qualified domain name, your cert will be self-signed but functioning. The control panel gives you full access to Minecraft's console through the local server, so no `mcrcon` or `screen` is needed.

## When would I use this?
When:
- You have a Linux server with a supported distribution (currently apt-based, like Debian & Ubuntu)
- You plan to use it for (currently) **only** 1 Minecraft server and 
- You don't care if this script runs destructively, changing whatever it wants to change (apt/rpm, systemd, Caddy configuration, etc). In particular, this installer overwrites /var/opt/minecraft and /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

Tested and working on:
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (recommended)
- Ubuntu 21.04
- Mint 20.1
- Debian 10
- Debian 11

Won't work (yet) on:
- Linux distributions based on something other than APT
- Architectures other than 64-bit

Won't work (ever) on:
- Systems without bash
- Probably Windows

## Installation

You will need to be root for the installation.

`sudo -s`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessicarobo/pink-wool/main/pink-wool.sh -O - | bash`

For post-install configuration, most of the relevant files will be in `/var/opt/minecraft/`.

## Commands

pink-wool.sh COMMAND

- **install**: installs Minecraft and the Pink Wool control panel, and all dependencies like Java and Caddy
- **minecraft-only**: non-interactively installs Minecraft and a systemd service
- **uninstall**: deletes Pink Wool and the folder where it installed Minecraft
- **update**: checks for a new version for Pink Wool
- **start/stop/restart**: performs the requested action on Minecraft's systemd service
- **backup**: Saves the Minecraft folder as a .zip (works best if Minecraft is not running)
- **do "RCON COMMAND"**: sends a command to the Minecraft console! For example, `do "say hiiii"` or `do "op JessicaRobo"`
- **help**: help

Web control panel commands: start, stop, restart, backup, and a minecraft admin console.

## To-do

- tutorial video
- multiple version support
- even more control panel stuff (installing new versions, uninstalling, updating)
- implement (programmer word meaning "steal") xpaw's status php (maybe no longer needed)
- broader distro support (CentOS is weird)
- broader architecture support
